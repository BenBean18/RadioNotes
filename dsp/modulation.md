# Modulation
This will be a running list of digital modulation modes I use and what I can find about them/how they work.

## Digital: PSK (phase-shift keying)
Linear Algebra! https://gist.github.com/BenBean18/05b86494a64c88a0273eda55f187f164

## Analog: SSTV (slow-scan TV)
- This seems like a really good resource: https://www.sstv-handbook.com/download/sstv_04.pdf
- The ISS uses the PD120 transmission method
- TODO write more

## Analog: FM (frequency modulation)

## Analog: AM (amplitude modulation)
